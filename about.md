<p>Hello! I am Koralp, a Master's student and computer scientist currently studying at KU Leuven. I am a prospective graduate of 2020 and planning to takeoff in my career after graduation. My main interest area is Artificial Intelligence, in which I specialize in, and write my thesis about. However, recently I have been widening my spectrum and exercising my skills in topics of Data Science and Cloud computing.

Throughout my coursework and internships, I have acquired various experiences and technicall skills that I have listed below at the [Skills](#skills) section. Although my skillset is broad, I am working over focusing my future works more towards Data Analysis and Engineering tech stacks, and taking extracurricular courses in order to keep up with the rapid-moving industry. More of these courses and certificates, I have also listed in [Certificates](#certificates) section.


As per fun traits, I am a calm natured person, with a small sprinkle of nerd & geek flowing through my soul. I really enjoy reading, and often try to make reviews of books on <a href = " https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> </p>. I have a vinyl collection, and can be considered as a junior audiophile, considering that I had 75k hours of listening time on Spotify in 2019!.
