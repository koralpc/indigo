<p>Hello! I am Koralp, a Master's student and computer scientist currently studying at KU Leuven. I am a prospective graduate of 2020 and planning to takeoff in my career after graduation. My main interest area is Artificial Intelligence, in which I specialize in, and write my thesis about. However, recently I have been widening my spectrum and exercising my skills in topics of Data Science and Cloud computing.</p>

<p>Throughout my coursework and internships, I have acquired various experiences and technicall skills that I have listed in my <a href="../assets/Koralp_Resume.pdf">Resume</a>. Although my skillset is broad, I am working over focusing my future works more towards Data Analysis and Engineering tech stacks, and taking extracurricular courses in order to keep up with the rapid-moving industry. More of these courses and certificates, I have also listed in my resume.</p>

<p>As per fun traits, I am a calm natured person, with a small sprinkle of nerd & geek flowing through my soul. I really enjoy reading, and often try to make reviews of books on <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81931280-koralp-atalsakal" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>. I have a vinyl collection, and can be considered as a junior audiophile, considering that I had 75k hours of listening time on Spotify in 2019!. My favorite genre is Indie rock and I made a playlist for myself,
